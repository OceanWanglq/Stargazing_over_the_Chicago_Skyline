This interactive artwork (https://oceanwanglq.github.io/Stargazing_over_the_Chicago_Skyline/) reimagines the Chicago nightscape with access to your camera. Clouds and stars are generated through random seeds, Perlin-noise flicker, making each rendering unique. Using the ml5.js HandPose model, your hand acts as a directional force within the scene. Raising a hand lifts clouds upward, revealing more of the star field; lowering the hand dims the city’s influence and increases star visibility; moving left or right shifts the clouds horizontally like a controlled wind.
